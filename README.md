# Getting and Cleaning Data Course projet
 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no 
questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github
repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in
the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.


#What you find in this repository: 

`CodeBook.md` describes the R codes that are to use.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

`secTidySet.txt` is the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject ask in the 5th step of the Project.
